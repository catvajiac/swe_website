      <h2>Spring 2015: Carolyn Etienne</h2>
      <img class = "highlightpic" src = "Officers/Carolyn%20Etienne%20square.jpg" alt = "Carolyn Etienne">
      <p class = "highlight">I am a Junior majoring in Mathematics at Saint Mary's College and Mechanical Engineering at Notre Dame. I am originally from Long Island, New York and currently work as a Resident Advisor at Saint Maryâ€™s. I  am involved in multiple clubs including Friends with Sisters and intramural volleyball. Outside of academics I am a lifeguard and I enjoy playing tennis, traveling, reading, and going to the beach in my spare time.This past summer I was a Mechanical Engineering intern at Allison Transmission, in Indianapolis. My work as an intern gave me the opportunity to learn more about the Mechanical Engineering field through a variety of  valuable hands-on experiences. I am looking forward to the future as I continue my education and become more immersed in my fields of study. </p>
